      "Abstract: The rise of global temperatures, over the past few decades, has disrupted the usual balance of nature. As a result of increasing temperatures, wildfires have destroyed millions of acres of land, thousands of structures, and homes. The pollution and toxic gases produced by the wildfires are carried out to thousands of miles, thus threatening the lives all around the world. Most wildfires occur due to anthropogenic factors, which cannot be predicted solely based on climate conditions. Henceforth, to detect wildfires before escalating, we propose iDrone, which is a wildfire detection system equipped with an end-to-end CNN image classification model: XtinguishNet, trained on a wildfire imagery dataset to detect the possible flames or smokes in an image. In addition, our approach also acquires the weather data and the intensity of the fire. Contrasting with existing wildfire detection systems, our proposed solution is a fusion …\n",

      "Abstract: Individuals with visual impairments often face a multitude of challenging obstacles in their daily lives. Vision impairment can severely impair a person's ability to work, navigate, and retain independence. This can result in educational limits, a higher risk of accidents, and a plethora of other issues. To address these challenges, we present MagicEye, a state-of-the-art intelligent wearable device designed to assist visually impaired individuals. MagicEye employs a custom-trained CNN-based object detection model, capable of recognizing a wide range of indoor and outdoor objects frequently encountered in daily life. With a total of 35 classes, the neural network employed by MagicEye has been specifically designed to achieve high levels of efficiency and precision in object detection. The device is also equipped with facial recognition and currency identification modules, providing invaluable assistance to the visually impaired. In addition, MagicEye features a GPS sensor for navigation, allowing users to move about with ease, as well as a proximity sensor for detecting nearby objects without physical contact. In summary, MagicEye is an innovative and highly advanced wearable device that has been designed to address the many challenges faced by individuals with visual impairments. It is equipped with state-of-the-art object detection and navigation capabilities that are tailored to the needs of the visually impaired, making it one of the most promising solutions to assist those who are struggling with visual impairments.\n",

      "Abstract: The utilization of consumer electronics, such as televisions, set-top boxes, home theaters, and air conditioners, has become increasingly prevalent in modern society as technology continues to evolve. As new devices enter our homes each year, the accumulation of multiple infrared remote controls to operate them not only results in a waste of energy and resources, but also creates a cumbersome and cluttered environment for the user. This paper presents a novel system, named SimplyMime, which aims to eliminate the need for multiple remote controls for consumer electronics and provide the user with intuitive control without the need for additional devices. SimplyMime leverages a dynamic hand gesture recognition architecture, incorporating Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction, to create a sophisticated system that enables users to interact with a vast majority of consumer electronics with ease. Additionally, SimplyMime has a security aspect where it can verify and authenticate the user utilising the palmprint, which ensures that only authorized users can control the devices. The performance of the proposed method for detecting and recognizing gestures in a stream of motion was thoroughly tested and validated using multiple benchmark datasets, resulting in commendable accuracy levels. One of the distinct advantages of the proposed method is its minimal computational power requirements, making it highly adaptable and reliable in a wide range of circumstances. The paper proposes incorporating this technology into all consumer electronic devices that currently require a secondary remote for operation, thus promoting a …\n",
